After a night on the moors, we walked through the Ryvoan Pass in light rain, the hills thick with fogâ€”everything heavy and silent and serene. We took shelter in a bothy at the edge of Abernethy Forest and listened as the trails were washed away, driving us back to the Pine Marten Bar and an early return to Marchmont the following morning.
