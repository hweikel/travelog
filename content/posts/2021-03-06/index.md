Spent the day in Welwyn Garden City, one of England's first "new towns." We approached from the south, following the central garden up through long rows of brick homes and churches and into the town center, which was dominated by a faded mall from the 80s and the usual smear of British High Street shops. It all felt slightly abortive, but the clarity of the idea was strikingâ€”not as vibrant as Ealing but more free.
